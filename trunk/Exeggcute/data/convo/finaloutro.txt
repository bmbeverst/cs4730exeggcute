Epsel: NOOOoooo. You have defeated me. I will never be able to make my movie now. All those disappearances I caused: Theodosia Burr Alston, the G AHNP Star Tiger, USS Cyclops, that Douglas DC 3 plane. For nothing! It would have made the best plot for my next movie. You probably figured this out by now, but I am not Epsel B. Grevstein. Think about that name. Move some letters around. You know who I am?...

That is right, I am Steven Spielberg. This was going to be my greatest project! And you...you ruined it! Now I will never leave this place. I am one with the ocean floor below the Bermuda Triangle.
